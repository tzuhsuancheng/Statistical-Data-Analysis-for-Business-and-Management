## Project: Predicting the retention of new customer for online room booking platform
In this project, we collaborate with AsiaYo, an online B&B booking platform company headquartered in Taiwan, to work together on solving their business problem using various statistical analysis method. One challenge facing AsiaYo is the customer retention, they want to find a better segementation method for making more effective marketing communication. Considering each customer has their own frequency for booking, we create RFM variables and then define a new variable called RT-Ratio(devide recency by frequency). Finally, we use the data of old customers with RFM and other multiple features to build: 
- (1) Multiple Linear Regression to predict RT-Ratio of new customer (the first-time buyer) 
- (2) GLM model to predict the probability of being alive for new customers
