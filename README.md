## Project: Predicting the retention of new customer for online room booking platform
In this project, we collaborate with AsiaYo, an online B&B booking platform company headquartered in Taiwan, to work together on solving their business problem using various statistical analysis methods. One challenge facing AsiaYo is customer retention, they want to find a better segmentation method for making more effective marketing communication. Considering each customer has their frequency for booking, we create RFM variables and then define a new variable called RT-Ratio(divide recency by frequency). Finally, we use the data of old customers, the customer who has more than 1 transaction, with RFM and other multiple features to build:
- (1) Multiple Linear Regression to predict RT-Ratio of new customer (the first-time buyer) 
- (2) GLM model to predict the probability of being alive for new customers
