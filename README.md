## Project: Predicting the retention of new customer for online room booking platform
- In this project, we collaborate with AsiaYo, an online B&B booking platform company headquartered in Taiwan, to work together on solving their business problem using various statistical analysis methods. One challenge facing AsiaYo is customer retention, they want to find a better segmentation method for making more effective marketing communication. Considering each customer has their frequency for booking, we create RFM variables and then define a new variable called RT-Ratio(divide recency by frequency). Finally, we use the data of old customers with RFM and other multiple features to build:
  - (1) Multiple Linear Regression to predict RT-Ratio of new customer 
  - (2) GLM model to predict the probability of new customers being alive

- We define the old customer and new customer as below:
  - New customer (88%): customers who make only one purchase
  - Old customer (12%): customers who make more than one purchase in a specific period of time
